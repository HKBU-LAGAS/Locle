A previously proposed solution to this problem is to apply program transformation in order to obtain non-recursive target predicates from recursive ones. However, the application of this method prevents recursive specializations from being found. In this work, we present the algorithm spectre ii which is not limited to specializing non-recursive predicates. The key idea upon which the algorithm is based is that it is not enough to specialize or remove clauses in refutations of negative examples in order to obtain correct specializations, but it is sometimes necessary to specialize clauses that appear only in refutations of positive examples. In contrast to its predecessor spectre, the new algorithm is not limited to specializing clauses defining one predicate only, but may specialize clauses defining multiple predicates. Furthermore, the positive and negative examples are no longer required to be instances of the same predicate. It is proven that the algorithm produces a correct specialization when all positive examples are logical consequences of the original program, there is a finite number of derivations of positive and negative examples and when no positive and negative examples have the same sequence of input clauses in their refutations.",
                " Inductive Constraint Logic. : A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is presented. Whereas present inductive logic programming systems employ examples as true and false ground facts (or clauses), we view examples as interpretations which are true or false for the target theory. This viewpoint allows to reconcile the inductive logic programming paradigm with classical attribute value learning in the sense that the latter is a special case of the former. Because of this property, we are able to adapt AQ and CN2 type algorithms in order to enable learning of full first order formulae. However, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form, we will use a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjuctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples. This representation duality reverses also the role of positive and negative examples, both in the heuristics and in the algorithm. The resulting theory is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint Logic).",

Instead of myopic impurity functions and lookahead, we propose to use RELI-EFF, an extension of RELIEF developed by Kira and Rendell [10], [11], for heuristic guidance of inductive learning algorithms. We have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems and the results are compared with some other well known machine learning algorithms. Excellent results on artificial data sets and two real world problems show the advantage of the presented approach to inductive learning." ],

Our earlier system, the Ring Array Processor (RAP), was a multiprocessor based on commercial DSPs with a low-latency ring interconnection scheme. We have used the RAP to simulate variable precision arithmetic and guide us in the design of higher performance neurocomputers based on custom VLSI. The RAP system played a critical role in this study, enabling us to experiment with much larger networks than would otherwise be possible. Our study shows that back-propagation training algorithms only require moderate precision. Specifically, 16b weight values and 8b output values are sufficient to achieve training and classification results comparable to 32b floating point. Although these results were gathered for frame classification in continuous speech, we expect that they will extend to many other connectionist calculations. We have used these results as part of the design of a programmable single chip microprocessor, SPERT. The reduced precision arithmetic permits the use of multiple units per processor. Also, reduced precision operands make more efficient use of valuable processor-memory bandwidth. For our moderate-precision fixed-point arithmetic applications, SPERT represents more than an order of magnitude reduction in cost over systems based on DSP chips.",
                 "Prosopagnosia in Modular Neural Network Models: There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing 'module' could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified.",
                 "Most connectionist modeling assumes noise-free inputs. This assumption is often violated. This paper introduces the idea of clearning, of simultaneously cleaning the data and learning the underlying structure. The cleaning step can be viewed as top-down processing (where the model modifies the data), and the learning step can be viewed as bottom-up processing (where the data modifies the model). Clearning is used in conjunction with standard pruning. This paper discusses the statistical foundation of clearning, gives an interpretation in terms of a mechanical model, describes how to obtain both point predictions and conditional densities for the output, and shows how the resulting model can be used to discover properties of the data otherwise not accessible (such as the signal-to-noise ratio of the inputs). This paper uses clearning to predict foreign exchange rates, a noisy time series problem with well-known benchmark performances. On the out-of-sample 1993-1994 test period, clearning obtains an annualized return on investment above 30%, significantly better than an otherwise identical network. The final ultra-sparse network with 36 remaining non-zero input-to-hidden weights (of the 1035 initial weights between 69 inputs and 15 hidden units) is very robust against overfitting. This small network also lends itself to interpretation."  ],

Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.",

This paper advocates an incremental revision framework for improving schedule quality and incorporating user dynamically changing preferences through Case-Based Reasoning. Our implemented system, called CABINS, records situation-dependent tradeoffs and consequences that result from schedule revision to guide schedule improvement. The preliminary experimental results show that CABINS is able to effectively capture both user static and dynamic preferences which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base.",

Both together enlarge the overall problem solving performance of Cbr and the explainability of case selection and adaptation considerably.

The analysis pertains to the ideal behavior of the algorithm where the main task reduces to showing convergence of probability distributions over the search space of combinatorial structures to the optimal one. We take exponential convergence to be indicative of efficient solvability for the sample-bounded algorithm, although a sampling theory is needed to better relate the limit behavior to actual behavior.

We investigate the potential benefits of using a given hierarchy over base classes to learn accurate multi-category classifiers for these domains. First, we consider the possibility of exploiting a class hierarchy as prior knowledge that can help one learn a more accurate classifier. We explore the benefits of learning category-discriminants in a hard top-down fashion and compare this to a soft approach which shares training data among sibling categories. In doing so, we verify that hierarchies have the potential to improve prediction accuracy. But we argue that the reasons for this can be subtle. Sometimes, the improvement is only because using a hierarchy happens to constrain the expressiveness of a hypothesis class in an appropriate manner. However, various controlled experiments show that in other cases the performance advantage associated with using a hierarchy really does seem to be due to the prior knowledge it encodes.",

We demonstrate that, with high probability, it is still possible to learn monotone DNF formulas in polynomial time, provided that the fraction of missing answers is bounded by some constant less than one. Even when half the membership queries are expected to yield no information, our algorithm will exactly identify m-term, n-variable monotone DNF formulas with an expected O(mn 2 ) queries. The same task has been shown to require exponential time using equivalence queries alone. We extend the algorithm to handle some one-sided errors, and discuss several other possible error models. It is hoped that this work may lead to a better understanding of the power of membership queries and the effects of faulty teachers on query models of concept learning.",],

According to Wilson's Generalization Hypothesis, XCS has a tendency towards generalization. With the XCS Optimality Hypothesis, I suggest that XCS systems can evolve optimal populations (representations); populations which accurately map all input/action pairs to payoff predictions using the smallest possible set of non-overlapping classifiers. The ability of XCS to evolve optimal populations for boolean multiplexer problems is demonstrated using condensation, a technique in which evolutionary search is suspended by setting the crossover and mutation rates to zero. Condensation is automatically triggered by self-monitoring of performance statistics, and the entire learning process is terminated by autotermination. Combined, these techniques allow a classifier system to evolve optimal representations of boolean functions without any form of supervision."],

A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as or, sum or max, on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms." ],

Though centralized control may achieve better results in controlling the system behavior, there are usually social, technical and security constraints on applying centralized control. Distributed control on the other hand may cope with these constraints but also entails suboptimal results and communicational overhead. Our concept of composable agents tries to allow a dynamic and fluent transition between globalization and localization in business process control by adapting to the current real-world system structure. We are currently evaluating this concept in the framework of a patient flow control project at Charit'e Berlin.

The algorithm enables the agents to combine (fuse) their plans in order to increase their joint profits. A computational resources and skills framework is developed for representing the planned activities of an agent under time constraints. Using this resource-skill framework, we present an ecient (polynomial time) algorithm that fuses the plans of a group of agents in such a way that their joint profits improve. The framework and the algorithm are illustrated using a simplified example from the freight transport domain. 1 Introduction Recently, much attention has been given to the topic of cooperation and cooperative planning in multiagent systems. Usually, the starting point for research on this problem is the observation that there exist classes of problems that cannot be solved by a single agent in isolation, but require several agents to work together in an interactive way, coordinating their plans and sharing ..."],
            "1":[" Data Mining in Soft Computing Framework: A Survey The present article provides a survey of the available literature on data mining using soft computing. A categorization has been provided based on the di#erent soft computing tools and their hybridizations used, the data mining function implemented, and the preference criterion selected by the model. The utility of the di#erent soft computing methodologies is highlighted. Generally fuzzy sets are suitable for handling the issues related to understandability of patterns, incomplete/noisy data, mixed media information and human interaction, and can provide approximate solutions faster. Neural networks are non-parametric, robust, and exhibit good learning and generalization capabilities in data-rich environments. Genetic algorithms provide e#cient search algorithms to select a model, from mixed media data, based on some preference criterion/objective function. Rough sets are suitable for handling di#erent types of uncertainty in data. Some challenges to data mining and the application of soft computing methodologies are indicated.

The concept of variable mutation operator is introduced for preserving the localized structure of the constituting knowledge based subnetworks, while they are integrated and evolved. Rough set dependency rules are generated directly from the real valued attribute table containing fuzzy membership values.

                "A Comparison of Mobile Agent and Client-Server Paradigms for Information Retrieval Tasks in Virtual Enterprises In next-generation enterprises it will become increasingly important to retrieve information efficiently and rapidly from widely dispersed sites in a virtual enterprise, and the number of users who wish to do using wireless and portable devices will increase significantly. This paper considers the use of mobile agent technology rather than traditional clientserver computing for information retrieval by mobile and wireless users in a virtual enterprise. We argue that to be successful mobile agent platforms must coexist with, and be presented to the applications programmer sideby -side with, traditional client-server middleware like CORBA and DCOM, and we sketch a middleware architecture for doing so. We then develop an analytical model that examines the claimed performance benefits of mobile agents over client-server computing for a mobile information retrieval scenario. Our evaluation of the model shows that mobile agents are not always better than client-server calls in terms of average response times; they are only beneficial if the space overhead of the mobile agent code is not too large or if the wireless link connecting the mobile user to the fixed servers of the virtual enterprise is error-prone.",
"Monadic Datalog and the Expressive Power of Languages for Web Information Extraction Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much activity in recent times (particularly systems implementations), but little work has been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study monadic datalog as a wrapping language (over ranked or unranked tree structures). Using previous work by Neven and Schwentick, we show that this simple language is equivalent to full monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for Web information extraction and thus propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and comparing wrappers. Using the above result, we study the kernel fragment Elog- of the Elog wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator). The striking fact here is that Elog- exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed, programs in this language can be entirely visually specified. We also formally compare Elog to other wrapping languages proposed in the literature."],

                "dQUOB: Managing Large Data Flows Using Dynamic Embedded Queries The dQUOB system satisfies client need for specific information from high-volume data streams. The data streams we speak of are the flow of data existing during large-scale visualizations, video streaming to large numbers of distributed users, and high volume business transactions. We introduces the notion of conceptualizing a data stream as a set of relational database tables so that a scientist can request information with an SQL-like query. Transformation or computation that often needs to be performed on the data en-route can be conceptualized ascomputation performed onconsecutive views of the data, with computation associated with each view. The dQUOB system moves the query code into the data stream as a quoblet; as compiled code. The relational database data model has the significant advantage of presenting opportunities for efficient reoptimizations of queries and sets of queries. Using examples from global atmospheric modeling, we illustrate the usefulness of the dQUOB system. We carry the examples through the experiments to establish the viability of the approach for high performance computing with a baseline benchmark. We define a cost-metric of end-to-end latency that can be used to determine realistic cases where optimization should be applied. Finally, we show that end-to-end latency can be controlled through a probability assigned to a query that a query will evaluate to true." ],

                 " Affine Object Representations for Calibration-Free Augmented Reality We describe the design and implementation of a videobased augmented reality system capable of overlaying threedimensional graphical objects on live video of dynamic environments. The key feature of the system is that it is completely uncalibrated: it does not use any metric information about the calibration parameters of the camera or the 3D locations and dimensions of the environment’s objects. The only requirement is the ability to track across frames at least four feature points that are specified by the user at system initialization time and whose world coordinates are unknown. Our approach is based on the following observation: Given a set of four or more non-coplanar 3D points, the projection of all points in the set can be computed as a linear combination of the projections of just four of the points. We exploit this observation by (1) tracking lines and fiducial points at frame rate, and (2) representing virtual objects in a non-Euclidean, affine frame of reference that allows their projection to be computed as a linear combination of the projection of the fiducial points. 1."],

The first is that the created neurule bases usually contain multiple representations of the same piece of knowledge. Also, the inference mechanism is rather connectionism oriented than symbolism oriented, thus reducing naturalness. To remedy these deficiencies, we introduce an extension to neurules, called multineurules, and an alternative inference process, which is rather symbolism oriented. Experimental results comparing the two inference processes are also presented.",

In the search for a drug with greater bioavailability and increased incorporation into neural tissue, ganglioside inner ester derivatives (AGF1) were recently developed. We evaluated the effect of AGF1 treatment on Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in homogenates of vagus nerve from alloxan-diabetic rats (100 mg/kg s.c.). Animals were treated with AGF1: 10 mg/kg 6 days/week i.p., or 30 mg/kg biweekly i.p. Treatment began 10 d post-alloxan and continued for 8 consecutive weeks. Normal age- and sex-matched rats were used as controls. Alloxan intoxication produced a 39% decrease in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of the vagus nerve, which was completely restored (96-97% recovery) by both AGF1 regimes. Results suggest that ganglioside inner ester derivatives may be used in the clinical setting for the management of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.",

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the compound has the same action in diabetes, because hypertriglyceridemia with low HDL cholesterol is an extremely common concomitant condition in diabetes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showed marked elevation of plasma triglyceride and reduction of HDL cholesterol. Both single and repeated administration of NO-1886 increased postheparin plasma LPL activity, with resulting reduction of plasma triglyceride and elevation of HDL cholesterol. Repeated administration increased the amount of LPL mRNA in adipose tissue and myocardium. The compound had no effects on plasma glucose and insulin levels. Our study indicates that the compound is potentially beneficial for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with low HDL cholesterol in diabetes.",

Vehicle-treated control rats (CR) and rats that were injected with STZ (STZR) after pretreatment with 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG), an agent that prevents STZ-induced hyperglycemia, were also studied. Basal values of total RBF (ml.min-1.g kidney wt-1, electromagnetic flow probe), systemic arterial pressure (BP, mmHg), and renal vascular resistance (RVR, BP/RBF) in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats during a control period were 5.4 +/- 0.3 (P less than 0.01 vs. CR), 116 +/- 3, and 21.9 +/- 1.0 (P less than 0.01 vs. CR) in STZR (n = 12) and 8.2 +/- 0.4, 121 +/- 2, and 15.3 +/- 1.0 in CR (n = 11), respectively. Basal values of RBF, BP, and RVR in 3-OMG-pretreated STZR were identical to CR. The relative capacity of STZR and CR kidneys for vasodilatation in situ in response to intrarenal arterial infusions of acetylcholine (ACh) and bradykinin (BK) and systemically administered sodium nitroprusside (NP) was evaluated. The capacity of STZR to exhibit active renal vasodilatation in response to intrarenal arterial ACh and BK was significantly less than that of CR (P less than 0.01). The minimum level to which RVR was suppressed after 50 micrograms NP/kg iv was higher in STZR than in either CR or 3-OMG-pretreated STZR (14.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.7 and 9.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg.ml-1.min.g kidney wt, respectively; P less than 0.05). This dose of NP exerted effective functional antagonism of renal vasoconstriction induced by exogenous norepinephrine and angiotensin II. These in vivo studies suggest that the elevated RVR in STZR might be attributable in part to structural changes in the renal vasculature that are associated with the diabetic state and limit the capacity for renal vasodilatation. However, there was no difference in pressure-flow relationships between the two groups in maximally dilated isolated kidneys perfused with Krebs buffer containing 5% albumin, and the RBF deficit in STZR kidneys was corrected by perfusion with blood from CR. Thus the decreased RBF exhibited by STRZ in vivo cannot be attributed solely to renal vascular structural changes associated with diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We abstracted and reviewed the medical records of 68 confirmed cases of Wolfram syndrome identified through a nationwide survey of endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, institutes, and homes for the blind. We also reviewed all available autopsy records. RESULTS: The most common causes of morbidity and mortality were the neurological manifestations of this syndrome and the complications of urinary tract atony. There was a lower frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis, no histologically proven diabetic glomerulosclerosis, and less severe, more slowly progressive, diabetic retinopathy than in classic type I diabetic patients. Mortality in Wolfram syndrome is much higher than in type I diabetes; 60% of Wolfram syndrome patients die by age 35. Recognition of these clinical differences from classic type I diabetes is important for the proper management of Wolfram syndrome patients. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of Wolfram syndrome patients among all diabetic patients presenting in childhood or adolescence is important because the management of patients with this syndrome is different from that of patients with classic type I diabetes.",
                "Title: Absence of adverse effects of severe hypoglycemia on cognitive function in school-aged children with diabetes over 18 months.\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Some children with type 1 diabetes may be at risk of cognitive impairments, but mechanisms of this effect have not been confirmed. The objective of this study was to determine whether severe hypoglycemia (SH) in children with type 1 diabetes is associated with cognitive decline over 18 months. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A sample of 142 6- to 15-year-old children with type 1 diabetes (mean age 11.6 +/- 2.7 years) enrolled in a trial of intensive therapy (IT) or usual care (UC) were tested with the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System at baseline and after 9 and 18 months. Episodes of SH were recorded by parents and reported promptly for verification by study nurses. HbA(1c) was measured quarterly. RESULTS: Over 18 months, 58 of 142 patients (41%) experienced 111 SH episodes, with a RR of SH of 1.12 for IT over UC. Neither occurrence nor frequency of SH was associated with decline in full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), standard scores for planning, attention, simultaneous processing, or successive processing, or scaled scores on any of eight subtests. The same findings emerged when only patients who had experienced hypoglycemic seizures or coma were included in the SH group for analyses. These effects persisted when the child's age, sex, type 1 diabetes duration, and age at diagnosis were controlled statistically. HbA(1c) during the trial was not associated with cognitive changes. CONCLUSIONS: SH did not induce adverse changes in the measures of cognitive function administered to 6- to 15-year-old children with type 1 diabetes in this study. Although SH should be avoided in all children with diabetes, these episodes did not have adverse effects on cognition in this age-group over 18 months.",
            "Title: PGE2, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha responses in diabetics as modifiers of periodontal disease expression.\n Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease that affects more than 12 million people in the United States and represents a risk factor for periodontitis with odds ratios of 2.1 to 3.0. New data support the concept that in diabetes-associated periodontitis, the altered host inflammatory response plays a critical role. We have recently examined the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) mediator level, monocytic secretion, and clinical presentation of 39 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients and 64 non-diabetic patients with various degrees of periodontal health and disease. First, we found that there was an unexpected high level of GCF mediators among the IDDM subjects, even in the gingivitis and mild periodontitis patients. Furthermore, the GCF and monocytic mediator responses were obviously bimodal in distribution with respect to periodontal status. Gingivitis patients and mild periodontitis patients represented one low response group, and the moderate and severe periodontitis subjects the high response group. Accordingly, these 4 periodontal subgroups were pooled to form 2 main groups for analyses--group A (AAP Types I-II) and group B (AAP Types III-IV). Diabetics had significantly higher GCF levels of both PGE2 and IL-1 beta when compared to non-diabetic controls with similar periodontal status. Within the diabetic group, the GCF levels of these inflammatory mediators were almost 2-fold higher in group B subjects when compared to diabetics from group A. Among diabetics, GCF TNF-alpha levels were only marginally detectable and no significant difference was found between group A and group B patients. Insulin-dependent diabetic patients with gingivitis or mild periodontitis (group A) and moderate to severe periodontitis (group B) have abnormal monocytic inflammatory secretion in response to LPS challenge from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) as compared to non-diabetic periodontal patients. Data suggest that the diabetic state results in a significantly upregulated monocytic secretion of PGE2 (4.2-fold), IL-1 beta (4.4-fold), and TNF-alpha (4.6-fold) when compared to non-diabetic controls. Within diabetics, LPS dose-response curves demonstrated that monocytes from group B patients secreted approximately 3 times more PGE2 and 6.2 times more TNF-alpha than those from group A; however, there was no significant difference in monocytic IL-1 beta secretion between the 2 diabetic groups. This upregulated monocytic trait is thought to exist independently of the presence of severe periodontal disease since, in non-diabetic patients with adult periodontitis, Gram-negative bacterial infections alone are not sufficient to elicit a systemic hyperresponsive monocytic trait. Between group A and group B diabetics, there was no significant difference in metabolic control as expressed by mean level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). In conclusion, our data suggest that diabetic patients have exaggerated inflammatory responses when compared to non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, within diabetics, individuals with moderate to severe periodontitis (group B) have significantly elevated monocytic secretion of PGE2 and TNF-alpha upon LPS challenge and significantly higher GCF levels of PGE2 and IL-1 beta when compared to patients with gingivitis or mild periodontal disease (group A). Thus, we suggest that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for more severe periodontal disease because, as compared to non-diabetics, diabetic subjects react with an abnormally high degree of inflammation to an equivalent bacterial burden."],
            "2":[" Title: Whole-grain and fiber intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence of a preventive effect of whole grain against type 2 diabetes is mainly based on data from women. Information specific to men and women is needed. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the relation between the intake of whole grain and fiber and the subsequent incidence of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: The design was a cohort study of 2286 men and 2030 women aged 40-69 y and initially free of diabetes. Food consumption data were collected from 1966 through 1972 with the use of a dietary history interview covering the habitual diet during the previous year. During a 10-y follow-up, incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified in 54 men and 102 women from a nationwide register. RESULTS: Whole-grain consumption was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk (adjusted for age, sex, geographic area, smoking status, body mass index, energy intake, and intakes of vegetables, fruit, and berries) between the highest and lowest quartiles of whole-grain consumption was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.18; P for trend = 0.02). Cereal fiber intake was also associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk between the extreme quartiles of cereal fiber intake was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.77; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An inverse association between whole-grain intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes was found. The similar result for cereal fiber intake suggests that the whole-grain association is due to cereal fiber or another factor related to cereal fiber intake.",
"Title: Insulin glulisine provides improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Insulin glulisine is a novel analog of human insulin designed for use as a rapid-acting insulin. This study compared the safety and efficacy of glulisine with regular human insulin (RHI) in combination with NPH insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 876 relatively well-controlled patients with type 2 diabetes (mean HbA1c 7.55%) were randomized and treated with glulisine/NPH (n = 435) or RHI/NPH (n = 441) for up to 26 weeks in this randomized, multicenter, multinational, open-label, parallel-group study. Subjects were allowed to continue the same dose of prestudy regimens of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) therapy (unless hypoglycemia necessitated a dose change). RESULTS: A slightly greater reduction from baseline to end point of HbA1c was seen in the glulisine group versus RHI (-0.46 vs. -0.30% with RHI; P = 0.0029). Also, at end point, lower postbreakfast (156 vs. 162 mg/dl [8.66 vs. 9.02 mmol/l]; P < 0.05) and postdinner (154 vs. 163 mg/dl [8.54 vs. 9.05 mmol/l]; P < 0.05) blood glucose levels were noted. Symptomatic hypoglycemia (overall, nocturnal, and severe) and weight gain were comparable between the two treatment groups. There were no between-group differences in baseline-to-end point changes in insulin dose. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily glulisine associated with NPH can provide small improvements in glycemic control compared with RHI in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already relatively well controlled on insulin alone or insulin plus OADs. The clinical relevance of such a difference remains to be established.",
"Title: Diabetic retinopathy and risk of heart failure.\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of diabetic retinopathy with incident heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Microvascular disease might play a more prominent role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy, a major cause of HF in diabetes. Whether diabetic retinopathy, a microvascular complication of diabetes, predicts HF is unclear. METHODS: A population-based study included 1,021 middle-aged type 2 diabetic persons with normal renal function and free of clinical coronary heart disease or HF at baseline. Diabetic retinopathy signs were graded from retinal photographs. Incident HF events were prospectively identified from hospital stay and death records. RESULTS: There were 125 (12.8%) participants with diabetic retinopathy. After 9-year follow-up, 106 (10.1%) participants developed incident HF events. Persons with retinopathy were more likely to develop HF (cumulative incidence of 21.6%) than those without retinopathy (cumulative incidence of 8.5%). After controlling for age, gender, race, smoking, diabetes duration, insulin use, blood pressure, lipid profile, and other risk factors, participants with retinopathy had more than 2.5-fold higher risk of developing HF than those without retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46 to 5.05). This association remained significant after further adjustments for glycemic control, carotid atherosclerosis, and serum markers of endothelial dysfunction (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.47). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diabetic retinopathy signifies an excess risk of HF, independent of known risk factors. This further supports a contribution of microvascular disease to the development of HF in people with diabetes."],

                It allows other programs to run and makes sure the computer resources like memory and processing power are used efficiently. Examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS. \
            Computer Architecture: \n  Computer architecture refers to the design of the internal components of a computer, like the CPU \
                (central processing unit), memory, and how these parts interact. It defines how a computer system is structured and how it performs tasks. \n \
            Computer Security: \n \
                Computer security is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. \
                    It includes techniques like encryption, firewalls, and authentication to keep data and systems safe. \n \
            Internet Protocols: \n Internet protocols are the rules and standards that allow devices to communicate over the internet. \
            Examples include IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensure that data can be sent and received between devices. \n \
            Computer File Systems: \n A file system is how data is stored and organized on a computer or storage device. It manages how files are named, \
                stored, and retrieved. Common file systems include NTFS (Windows) and ext4 (Linux). \n \
            Distributed Computing Architecture: \n  Distributed computing involves using multiple computers working together over a network to solve a \
            problem or perform a task. Instead of one computer doing all the work, the task is split into parts and processed by several machines, often to improve speed or handle large datasets. \n \
            Web Technology: \n Web technology refers to the tools and techniques used to build websites and web applications. \
            It includes things like HTML (the structure of web pages), CSS (styling), JavaScript (interactivity), and the servers and databases that power the web. \n \
            Programming Language Topics: \n Programming languages are used to write software that computers can understand. Common languages include Python, Java, \
            and C++. Programming language topics cover syntax, semantics, data types, control structures, and more, which define how the language is used to instruct the computer."
